Hi,

rdf4h-4.0.0 has been released.

This library [1,2] is for working with semantic web RDF data. It
includes multiple graph representations, RDF parsers/serialisers, and
an API for querying and modifying RDF graphs.

Version 4.0.0 is significant because it is the first release of the
rdf4h library to be 100% compliant [3] with the parser unit tests
defined by the W3C RDF Test Suite Curation Community Group [4] for
parsing NTriple, Turtle and XML RDF formats.

Special thanks to Slava Kravchenko, Pierre Le Marre and Renzo
Carbonara whose efforts contributed to this milestone.
