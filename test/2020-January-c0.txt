                           WST 2020 - Call for Papers
                    17th International Workshop on Termination
                        http://costa.fdi.ucm.es/wst2020

                         July 4-5, 2020, Paris, France
                      co-located with IJCAR and FSCD 2020.
==========================================================================

The Workshop on Termination (WST) traditionally brings together, in an
informal setting, researchers interested in all aspects of termination,
whether this interest be practical or theoretical, primary or derived.
The workshop also provides a ground for cross-fertilization of ideas from
the different communities interested in termination (e.g., working on
computational mechanisms, programming languages, software engineering,
constraint solving, etc.). The friendly atmosphere enables fruitful
exchanges leading to joint research and subsequent publications.

The workshop is co-located with IJCAR and FSCD 2020.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  * submission deadline:  April 12, 2020
  * notification:         May 10, 2020
  * final version due:    May 31, 2020
  * workshop:             July 4-5, 2020

TOPICS: The 17th International Workshop on Termination welcomes
contributions on all aspects of termination. In particular, papers
investigating applications of termination (for example in complexity
analysis, program analysis and transformation, theorem proving, program
correctness, modeling computational systems, etc.) are very welcome.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * abstraction methods in termination analysis
  * certification of termination and complexity proofs
  * challenging termination problems
  * comparison and classification of termination methods
  * complexity analysis in any domain
  * implementation of termination methods
  * non-termination analysis and loop detection
  * normalization and infinitary normalization
  * operational termination of logic-based systems
  * ordinal notation and subrecursive hierarchies
  * SAT, SMT, and constraint solving for (non-)termination analysis
  * scalability and modularity of termination methods
  * termination analysis in any domain (lambda calculus, declarative
    programming, rewriting, transition systems, etc.)
  * well-founded relations and well-quasi-orders

COMPETITION: Since 2003, the catalytic effect of WST to stimulate
new research on termination has been enhanced by the celebration
of the Termination Competition and its continuously developing
problem databases containing thousands of programs as challenges
for termination analysis in different categories, see

    http://termination-portal.org/wiki/Termination_Competition

In 2020, the Termination Competition will run shortly before WST and
the main venues (IJCAR-FSCD), and the results will be presented at
IJCAR or FSCD.

SUBMISSION: Submissions are short papers/extended abstracts which
should not exceed 5 pages. There will be no formal reviewing. In
particular, we welcome short versions of recently published articles
and papers submitted elsewhere. The program committee checks relevance
and provides additional feedback for each submission. The accepted
papers will be made available electronically before the workshop.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission page:
